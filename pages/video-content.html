          We are passionate about the art of batik making. It is a cultural
          representation of Malaysia's kaleidoscopic society that are very much
          valued. Our batik-making process requires intricacy, creativity,
          passion and determination as everything is hand-drawn from scratch. We
          are proud of our art and wishes to protect this cultural heritage.

          Bujin's love for batik making art is deeply ingrained in him. He
          eventually began opening showrooms for exclusive batik collections in
          Kuala Lumpur. At the same time, he started Bujin Academy to teach
          rural folks especially the young, the art of batik. As a result, his
          students managed to reach the final stage of Piala Seri Endon in 2013,
          2014 and 3 teams as semi-finalists in 2015.
